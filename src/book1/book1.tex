    \section*{Introduction}

    When I first worked through the Elements, I found it difficult to understand the propositions without referring to the figures. Unfortunately, the figures often give away the solution as well, which robbed me of the opportunity to work through it myself. In this supplement, I present each proposition as a problem to be solved \textbf{without} a solution. That way you can try your hand at each proposition without accidentally seeing the answer.

    The goal of this supplement is to present figures and enough commentary for you to take a stab at working through the propositions yourself before reading Euclid's solution. It is not a replacement for a full translation.

    I referred to the John Casey translation, which is the public domain and freely available from Project Gutenberg\footnote{http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21076}. The translations of the propositions in this document are taken directly from that source with the assumption that the reader may want to refer to the original after trying the problems for themselves. Casey's translation contains a wealth of interesting and worthwhile content including solutions, exercises, and commentary.

    In addition to Casey's translation of each Proposition, I provide instructions using modern language. I hope this makes it easier to focus on the geometry instead of struggling with century-old English.

    Use the provided pictures as a starting point for each problem. They are essentially the same as the images in Casey's translation of Euclid, but I took an eraser to remove all the steps to the solution. Your completed diagrams may resemble Euclid's, or you might find a different answer!

    Some of these problems are difficult if you're seeing them for the first time (or if it has been many years since you've practiced geometry.) Don't get discouraged, and don't feel guilty about looking at the answers if you get stuck. This is a game meant to be enjoyed.

    A final word of advice: You may occasionally notice some holes in Euclid's theory of geometry. Even in the solution to the very first problem, a point appears that cannot be justified to exist strictly by the Postulates and Axioms alone\footnote{If you are interested in learning about the logical deficiencies in the \textit{Elements}, see the short essay ``The Teaching of Euclid" by Bertrand Russel for an introduction. However, please don't let it stop you from enjoying the \textit{Elements} on its own terms.}. However, even if the theory is not perfect, it is undeniably useful. I like to approach these problems pretending I am a draftsman attempting to draw an accurate technical diagram using the tools I have available: compass and unmarked ruler. I am satisfied when I can draw the figure and explain why it is correct, even if the justification isn't entirely rigorous. Indeed, Euclid's techniques are still useful for artists and craftsmen even today.

    \section{Proposition 1}
    \begin{proposition}
        On a given finite right line (AB) to construct an equilateral triangle.
    \end{proposition}

    Your goal is to draw an equilateral triangle with line $AB$ as one of its sides, using only the following moves:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item You may connect any two points with a line.
        \item You may extend any line indefinitely in either direction.
        \item You may draw a circle centered on any point with radius equal to the distance between the center and any other point.
    \end{enumerate}
    These moves are called "postulates", and they can be accomplished with a compass and an unmarked ruler.

    \section{Proposition 43}
    \begin{proposition}
    The parallels (EF, GH) through any point (K) in one of the diagonals (AC) of a parallelogram divide it into four
    parallelograms, of which the two (BK, KD) through which the diagonal does not pass, and which are called the
    complements of the other two, are equal.
    \end{proposition}
    We have
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $AD$, $EF$, and $BC$ are all parallel, and
        \item $AB$, $HG$, and $DC$ are all parallel.
    \end{enumerate}
    Show
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $AHKE$, $HDFK$, $EKGB$ and $KFCG$ are all parallelograms, and
        \item the area of $EKGB$ is equal to the area of $HDFK$.

    \section{Proposition 47 (Pythagorean Theorem)}
    \begin{proposition}
    In a right-angled triangle (ABC) the square on the hypotenuse (AB) is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides (AC, BC).
    \end{proposition}
    We have arrived at the crescendo of Book 1. This may be the most famous result in all of mathematics. There are hundreds of distinct proofs, 118 of which can be found on the wonderful website cut-the-knot.org\footnote{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/}.

    Given $\angle{C}$ is a right angle, show $AC^2 + CB^2 = AB^2$.

    \begin{proposition}
    If the square on one side (AB) of a triangle be equal to the sum of the squares on the remaining sides (AC, CB),
    the angle (C) opposite to that side is a right angle.
    \end{proposition}
    Given $AC^2 + CB^2 = AB^2$, show $\angle{C}$ is a right angle.
