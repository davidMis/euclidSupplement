# Supplement for Euclid's Elements

When I first worked through the Elements, I found it difficult to understand the propositions without referring to the figures. Unfortunately, the figures often give away the solution as well, which robbed me of the opportunity to work through it myself. In this supplement, I present each proposition as a problem to be solved *without* a solution. That way you can try your hand at each proposition without accidentally seeing the answer.

The goal of this supplement is to present figures and enough commentary for you to take a stab at working through the propositions yourself before reading Euclid's solution. It is not a replacement for a full translation.

This is certainly a work-in-progress, and all feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated. I would also be overjoyed to hear if you enjoyed it.
